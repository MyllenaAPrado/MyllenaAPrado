🎓 **About Me**

I’m a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Texas State University, with a passion for image quality assessment, computer vision, and cutting-edge deep learning techniques. 

🔬 My current work explores how we perceive visual data. I'm building methods to assess the quality of Light Field Images using models like Vision Transformers, and Graph Convolutional Networks.
